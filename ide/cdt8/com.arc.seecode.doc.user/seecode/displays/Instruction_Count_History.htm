<h1>Instruction Count History window</h1>

<p>The Instruction Count History window shows disassembled code for your program. Labels of the form <i>.0</i>, <i>.1</i>, <i>.2</i>, and so on, are displayed in the left margin. Each label corresponds to a symbolic label and may be used to represent a symbol. This convention saves horizontal space in the window.</p>

<p>These labels change their associations when the Instruction Count History window is updated. You can use a label in a simple expression (for example, to specify the address of a breakpoint) for as long as the same values are on display -- once the Instruction Count History window is closed, all associations are discarded.</p>

<p>When the left margin shows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a green arrow, the program has stopped on the line</li>
  <li>a magenta arrow, a stack frame is not currently active; the arrow shows where the program will be when control re-enters the stack frame</li>
  <li>a solid red rectangle, a breakpoint is set on the line; when the letter &quot;T&quot; is displayed, the breakpoint is specific to a thread, which you can identify through the <a href="../displays/Breakpoints_Display.htm">Breakpoints</a> window</li>
  <li>a grey rectangle, the breakpoint is disabled</li>
</ul>
