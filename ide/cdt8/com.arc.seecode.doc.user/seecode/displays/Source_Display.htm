<h1>Source window</h1>

<p><i>Note:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Source is displayed only for code that was compiled with debugging information (the <b>-g</b> option).</p>

<p>The Source window lets you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>set or remove breakpoints</li>
  <li>evaluate variables</li>
  <li>view profiling information</li>
  <li>save to a file</li>
<!-- the following three items are not described below, so they are commented out
  <li>advance program execution to the cursor position (run to cursor)</li>
  <li>navigate the stack frame</li>
  <li>open a display for corresponding disassembly</li>
 -->
</ul>

<h2>Setting or removing a breakpoint</h2>

<p>To set or remove a breakpoint, do any one of the following in the Source window:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Double-click a line of source.</li>
  <li>Right-click a line of source, and then click <b>Break</b>.</li>
  <li>Select a line of source, and then click the <b>Break</b> button.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the left margin shows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a green arrow, the program has stopped on the line</li>
  <li>a magenta arrow, a stack frame is not currently active; the arrow shows where the program will be when control re-enters the stack frame</li>
  <li>a solid red rectangle, a breakpoint is set on the line</li>
  <li>a grey rectangle, the breakpoint is disabled</li>
</ul>

<h2>Evaluating the value of a variable</h2>

<p>To evaluate the value of a variable: Right-click on or within one character of a variable, and then select <b>Evaluate</b>.
</p>

<h2>Viewing profiling information</h2>

<p>If the code was compiled with profiling information and your target
 supports profiling, you can view profiling data in the Source window.
 </p>

<ol>
  <li>Right-click, and then select <b>Profiling</b>.</li>
  <li>Select any number of menu items from the top half of the menu.</li>
  <p>A column is added to the Source window that contains a profile for the type of profiling you chose.</p>
  <p><i>Tip:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Reselecting the item removes the column.</p>
</ol>

<h2>Saving your data to a file</h2>
<p>To save your data to a file, right click and select <b>Save to File.</b></p>
<h2>Troubleshooting the Source window</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Problem: Source window is not showing source code</dt>
<dd>If the Source window displays &quot;Not stopped
 in known source&quot;, your source file may have been moved, renamed,
 or deleted from the directory in which it was compiled.</dd>
<dt>Solution:</dt>
<dd>In the <b>Command:</b> field, type:
<br><tt>set source_path=</tt><i>path</i>, where <i>path</i> is the full path to the source file.</dd>
<dt>Example:</dt>
<dd><tt>set source_path=c:\hcarc\demos\</tt></dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>Problem: Unable to set a breakpoint</dt>
<dd>To set a breakpoint, you must first compile with debugging information (the <b>-g</b> option).</dd>
</dl>
