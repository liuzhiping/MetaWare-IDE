<h1>Watchpoints window</h1>

<p>The Watchpoints window shows all set <a href="Watchpoint.htm">watchpoints</a>. 
  Use the window to monitor, manage, and control watchpoints.</p>

<p>The letter H in the left margin indicates a hardware watchpoint. Hardware
  watchpoints allow programs to run at full speed--program execution stops when access to the watched entity occurs. If you are stepping through source
  or disassembly and the program stops execution, the debugger shows if there has been any change in value after the current step is completed.</p>

<p>If your target system does not support hardware watchpoints, your program will
  stop on a watchpoint only if you are running in <a href="../tasks/Animate.htm">animation</a>
  mode. Typically, processors that offer hardware assist do so only for memory,
  and in sizes of 1, 2, and 4 bytes. However, simulators such as the <a href="ISS.htm">ISS</a> offer more &quot;hardware&quot; assist, such as register watchpoints. Without
  hardware assist, the only way to run the program and still detect watchpoint
  changes is by <a href="../tasks/Animate.htm">animating</a> a step action. When the debugger detects that a watchpoint
  has changed, it stops <a href="../tasks/Animate.htm">animation</a> and displays the previous and changed
  values separated by an arrow (=&gt;).</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>
H register r3 [hit:4 times] data-write
value: 0x01c9b4 =&gt; 0x0384a2
</pre>

<h2>Adding and removing watchpoints</h2>

<p>To add a watchpoint:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click the <b>Set</b> button. <br>
    Or <br>
    Right-click and then select <b>Set</b>.</li>
  <li>Use the <a href="../tasks/set_watchpoint.htm">Set Watchpoint</a> dialog 
    to set the breakpoint.<br>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>To remove a watchpoint:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the watchpoint.</li>
  <li>Click the <b>Remove</b> button.
  <br>Or
  <br>Right-click and then select <b>Remove</b>.</li>
</ol>

<p>To remove all watchpoints:</p>

  <br>Or
  <br>
    Right-click and then select <b>Remove All</b>. 
    <p></p>
</ol>

<h3>Enabling and disabling watchpoints</h3>

<p>Disabled watchpoints do not halt execution or animation. You can disable a watchpoint or re-enable a disabled watchpoint anytime after the watchpoint has been added.</p>

<p>To disable a breakpoint:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the watchpoint.</li>
  <li>Click the <b>Enable/disable</b> button.
  <br>Or
  <br>
    Right-click and then select <b>Enable/disable</b>. </li>
  <p>When '-' is displayed in the left margin, the watchpoint on that line has been disabled.</p>
</ol>

<p>To disable all watchpoints:

<ol>
  <li>Click the <b>All</b> button beside the <b>Enable/Disable</b> button.
  <br>Or
  <br>
    Right-click and then select <b>Enable/Disable All</b>.
