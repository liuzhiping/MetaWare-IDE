<h1>Image Memory window</h1>

<p>The Image Memory window shows the data being displayed in the image as if that 
  data were memory, even if the image source isn't memory.</p>
<p>For example, the image source can be a vector 
  register file.</p>
<p>The columns are titled with the offset from the address given on the left edge.</p>
<p>The window shows its contents in the default size of the image element, either 
  1, 2, or 4 bytes.</p>
