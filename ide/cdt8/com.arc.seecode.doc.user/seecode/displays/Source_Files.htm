<h1>Source files window</h1>

<p>The Source Files window shows all source files for which the debugger has line 
  information. Files are sorted alphabetically.</p>

<p><i>Note:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular expressions such as <tt>*.h</tt>, <tt>*.cc</tt>, or <tt>*input*</tt> can be used to restrict the number of files in the list.

<p>The Source Files window also lists the names of all functions and/or file-scope variables that are declared in a source file: clicking '+' in the left margin expands the list.</p>

<h2>Viewing source for a file, function, or variable</h2>

<p>To view source for a file, function, or variable: Select a line and click the <b>Source</b> button.

<p>Double-clicking a line has the following effect:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the line shows a source file, a <a href="Source_Display.htm">Source</a> 
    window opens on that file</li>
  <li>If the line shows a variable, the variable is shown in an Examine window</li>
  <li>If the line shows a function, a breakpoint is set at the function's entry point</li>
</ul>
