How to build and IDE distribution under Eclipse 3.5
---------------------------------------------------
By David Pickens;  Sept 4, 2009

[NOTE: this is for ARC developers only; it is not to be shipped as part of the IDE!]


Any product based on Eclipse 3.5 (or later) must be based on the 
"Equinox Provisioning" system, known as "p2".  

The "Create Product" wizard of Eclipse 3.5 is supposedly integrated into the P2 
system, but it has bugs that will cause you major headaches. Perhaps you
are reading this after a later version of Eclipse has been made available.
If that is the case, then perhaps many of the details given here will no
longer be relevant.

Assuming you have the IDE source under Eclipse, look in project 
"com.arc.cdt.toolchain". You will see a file named "ide.product". Open it
with the Product Configuration Editor via right-click menu.

(The hard part was getting all of the dependent features listed. I had
neglected to include the "org.eclipse.equinox.p2.user.ui" and the IDE built
without error; but the result was nondeterministically flakey - random
errors appeared in the error log, etc.)

In the Product Configuration Editor, select the "Overview" tab and select
the hyperlink "Eclipse Product export wizard".

When the wizard dialog pops up, set the destination "Directory" to the right
path. Then select "Finish". After about 20 or 30 minutes, you should have
a distribution. However, it won't run as is!

You must make manual fixes to the "bundles.info" file, the "config.ini" file, 
the profile file, and the "eclipse.ini" file.

Fixing bundles.info file
------------------------

In your distribution directory, edit 
"eclipse/configuration/org.eclipse.equinox.simpleconfigurator/bundles.info".

This file contains a list of plugins, a startup "level" number, and a boolean
to indicate that it is to be activated at startup (as opposed to lazily).

Make sure the plugin "org.eclipse.core.runtime" is at level 4, and startup is set to 
"true". If this is set to false, the IDE will not even start.

Make sure "org.eclipse.equinox.ds" is set to level 2, startup=true.

Make sure "org.eclipse.equinox.p2.reconciler.dropins" has startup set to "true", 
otherwise, the "dropins" and "links" facility won't work.

And one more change. This one is a mysterious one. The plugin 
"org.eclipse.equinox.p2.exemplarysetup"
must be started *before* "org.eclipse.equinox.p2.metadata.repository" because the latter uses
a service provided by the former. In the SDK, the correct activation "just happens". But in the
IDE, their activations are done in the wrong order more than 50% of the time. This problem
manifests as the following message appearing in the error log:
 "ProvisioningEventBus could not be obtained. Metadata caches may not be cleaned up properly."
When the IDE is brought up under the Eclipse debugger to see how this occurs, the problem never occurs!
The work-around is to set the "start" parameter to "true" for 
"org.eclipse.equinox.p2.exemplarysetup" and make sure it is physically before 
"org.eclipse.equinox.p2.metadata.repository" in the list.

Fixing config.ini file
----------------------
In your distribution directory, edit
"eclipse/configuration/config.ini".

The profile property should be set like so:

eclipse.p2.profile=com.arc.ide

The default one is "profile". There doesn't seem to be any automatic way to alter this.

Also confirm this property is set like so:

eclipse.p2.data.area=@config.dir/../p2/

Fixing profile file
----------------------
In your distribution directory,
"eclipse/p2/org.eclipse.equinox.p2.engine/profileRegistry",
rename the subdirectory "profile.profile" to "com.arc.ide.profile".

Within that directory, you will see multiple *.profile files. Only the one
that is last in alphabetical order is necessary. You can remove the others.

IMPORTANT: the *.profile file that you leave must be edited so that the
third line reads:

<profile id='com.arc.ide' timestamp='...'>


Fixing eclipse.ini
------------------

Edit the file "eclipse/eclipse.ini" by appending the following lines to it:

    --launcher.XXMaxPermSize
    256m
    -vmargs
    -Xms40m
    -Xmx256m


Installing "mide" driver
----------------------
At the root of your distribution directory, copy the following files from the previous
IDE distribution:
    mide.exe  (or just "mide" under Linux)
    mide.ini
    samples.xml

Under Linux, also copy over the icons.
