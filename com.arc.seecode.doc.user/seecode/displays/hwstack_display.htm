<h1>Hardware Stack window</h1>

<p>The Hardware Stack window is a variant of the <a href="../displays/Memory_Display.htm">Memory</a> window. The Hardware
  Stack window shows memory with the display width being the natural size of
  elements on the runtime stack. The stack pointer register is displayed to the right
  of the line whose address equals the value of the stack pointer. </p>

<p>The stack can be viewed in ascending or descending order of memory. To reverse the order, click the <b>memup</b> button.</p>

<p>For stacks that grow down, memory is displayed in descending addresses,
 and the stack pointer register stays near the bottom. For
 stacks that grow up, memory is displayed in ascending order, and the
 stack pointer register stays near the top. The displayed addresses change to ensure
 that the stack pointer register is always visible.</p>

<p>To change the base numbering system for displaying memory, choose one
 of the following options from the <b>Base</b> box:</p>

<ul>
  <li>16 (hexadecimal)</li>
  <li>10 (decimal)</li>
  <li>8 (octal)</li>
  <li>2 (binary)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Modifying the value of a memory address</h2>

<p>To modify the value of a memory address:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click the value that you want to change, and then click the <b>Change</b> button.
  <br>Or
  <br>Right-click the value, and then click <b>Change</b>.
  <p>The Change dialog is displayed.</p>

  <li>Modify the value in the <b>New value</b> field of the Change dialog, and then click <b>OK</b>.</li>
</ol>
