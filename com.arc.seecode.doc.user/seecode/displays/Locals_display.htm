<h1>Local Variables window</h1>

<p>The Local Variables window displays the local variables of your program. All 
  scopes from the current function's innermost scope out to the file scope are 
  included. Non-exported (static) variables are also shown (non-exported variables 
  are local to the current file).</p>

<p>The variables are listed one per line, from innermost to outermost scope. Scope indicators show you the boundaries between scopes. To show or hide addresses, click <b>A.</b></p>

<p>Local variables are displayed only for functions that were compiled with debugging information (the <b>-g</b> option).</p>

<h2>Saving your data to a file</h2>
<p>To save your data to a file, right click and select <b>Save to File.</b></p>
