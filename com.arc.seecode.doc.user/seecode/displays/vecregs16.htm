<h1>Videocore vector registers window (16-bit)</h1>

<p> The Vector Registers window shows the Videocore vector register file as if 
  it were an array of 16-bit values. The columns are titled with the word index 
  into each vector. The rows are titled with the vector number.</p>
<p>In the 16-bit view, 8-bit values are paired to produce 16-bit values. The pairing 
  is not trivial, but if you program the VRF directly the pairing is more easily 
  understood. The VideoCore Processor Architecture manual explains the pairing 
  of 8-bit values.</p>
<p> The following is an excerpt from the <i>VideoCore Processor Architecture manual</i> 
  to help explain the pairing of 8-bit values:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>The 16-bit value at (0,0) is made up of the 8 bits at (0,0) in the 64x64 
    byte register file as the least significant (LS) half, and the 8 bits at (0,16) 
    in the 64x64 byte register file as the most significant (MS) half. </i></p>
  <p><i>Furthermore, (y,x) coordinates are always given referring to the original 
    64x64 byte view of the VRF. Specifically, we therefore have that the 16-bit 
    value at (i,j) written PX(i,j) is given by:</i></p>
  <p><i> PX(i,j) = P(i,j) + (P(i,j+16) &lt;&lt; 8)</i></p>
</blockquote>
