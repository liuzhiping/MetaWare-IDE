<h2 class="topictitle2">Terminal Emulation</h2>

<table class="steptable"><tr><td class="S_step_text">
The <b>Terminal</b> view is an ANSI-conformant terminal emulator. You can use the
<b>Terminal</b> view to telnet into a remote UNIX host.
</td></tr></table>

<table class="steptable"><tr><td class="S_step_text">
To do so, set the <b>TERM</b> environment variable on the remote host to <b>ansi</b>.
This enables programs on the remote host, such as <b>vi</b> and <b>Emacs</b>,
to display text properly.
The <b>Terminal</b> view does not currently support other emulation modes, such as VT100.
</td></tr></table>

<table class="steptable"><tr><td class="S_step_text">
The <b>size</b> of the terminal window as understood by the remote is automatically
adjusted as the size of your <b>Terminal</b> view changes.
The <b>colors</b> and <b>font</b> used by the Terminal can be configured in the
Eclipse Preferences, Appearance section. A separate <b>Terminal</b> Preference
Page allows inverting the terminal colors easily if desired.
</td></tr></table>

<h4>Optional Command Input Field</h4>

<table class="steptable"><tr><td class="S_step_text">
The optional <b>Command Input Field</b> can be enabled when sending commands to a dumb
terminal that does not support cursor keys for editing. In such a case, the <b>
Command Input Field</b> provides a full editor that supports cursor navigation, copy
and paste, as well as a history of previous commands that can be accessed by
<b>Ctrl+Space</b> content assist.
</td></tr></table>

<table class="steptable"><tr><td class="S_step_text">
If more space than the default single editing line is needed for very complex commands,
the <b>Command Input Field</b> can be enlarged by dragging its upper handle up with 
the mouse.
</td></tr></table>
